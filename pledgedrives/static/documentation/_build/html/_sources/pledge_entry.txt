Pledge Entry Screen
====================

At the top of the page, you see:

    * a link to Home, to the main page of the Pledge Drive Tracker

    * Your organization name, phone number, long distance number and web address.

Other parts of the screen include:

    * Top Left: Producer Message Chat Window.  Here, the producer can send messages to the on-air staff, and the on-air staff and pledge entry staff can respond here as well.

    * Top Middle: Pledge Drive Totals.  The total pledges and dollars for the current segment are displayed here.  Please note: this query takes a lot of processing power, so it is not updated automatically.  To update this, simply click on the "Refresh Totals" button.

    * Top Right: Goals and Totals for the Current Segment.  The total pledges and dollars for the current segment are displayed here, as well as the goal and progress towards that goal.

    * Bottom Left: Producer Messages.  Here is where messages to and from the producer are displayed.

    * Bottom Center: Thank You Names. Information about the most recent pledges are displayed here.

    * Bottom Left: Pledge Entry Form.  When entering a pledge, along with the dollar amount, there are optional fields for the pledger's name, along with comments.  Entering the pledgers name allows the on-air staff to thank listeners for their donations on the air.  Some people have found it useful to include, as a comment for each pledge, the intials of the person entering the pledges (which helps if you have multiple people entering pledges into the system and you have to go back to edit a pledge).
